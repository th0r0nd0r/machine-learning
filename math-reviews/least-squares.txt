Residual: the difference in the output for a given input from the expected output (based on the regression)

Least Squares: sum up the squared residuals of all points, try to find a regression that minimizes this number.

Why square residuals, not use absolute value?
- squaring the #s gives more weight to numbers farther away from the tested regression.
