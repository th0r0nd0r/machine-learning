Linear Regression

Old faithful: come up with a way to predict next eruption

Ways to solve:
- get pairs of inputs/outputs
    - how long geyser erupted for (input)
    - how long waited until next eruption (output)

come up with a simple function that takes an input and spits out the predicted output

ex: (wait time) = w0 + (last duration) * w1
[y = mx + b]
