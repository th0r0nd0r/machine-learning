Linear Regression

Old faithful: come up with a way to predict next eruption

Ways to solve:
- get pairs of inputs/outputs
    - how long geyser erupted for (input)
    - how long waited until next eruption (output)

come up with a simple function that takes an input and spits out the predicted output

ex: (wait time) = w0 + (last duration) * w1
[y = mx + b]

Expanding to more dimensions (3, depends on 2 inputs):

(output) = w0 + (input 1)*w1 + (input 2)*w2


Generalized function:

Note: he writes the allowed values of the input as R^d.  The d just means it's the domain of the function (the set of input values for which the function is defined)

Data:
Input: x E R^d (measurements, covariates, features, independent variables)
Output: y # R (response, dependent variable)

Goal:
find a function f : R^d => R such that y = f(x;w)
